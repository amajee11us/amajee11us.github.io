    - title: Research Intern
      institution: Dolby Laboratories, San Francisco, CA
      year: 2025
      description:
        - Developed a Multi-Modal Generative Model (GenAI) for improving Video-Language understanding in long-form video sequences. To be submitted to CVPR'26.
        - Inspired from Live Sports and Cinema content, not all frames in a video is relevant to understanding tasks, we developed a combinatorial approach to identify a set of video segments relevant to answering the question achieving \(\sim\)4% boost in performance on several Video LLMs.
    - title: Research Intern
      institution: Fujitsu Research of America (FRA), Santa Clara, CA
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Developed a Multi-modal Foundation Model, TabGLM towards cross-table generalization in tabular data. This work has been accepted to AAAI'25.
        - TabGLM minimizes the consistency between graph (learnt from a Graph Transformer network) and text (learnt from a BART based Large Language Model (LLM) encoder) modalities generated from each record in large tables.
