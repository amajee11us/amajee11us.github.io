I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Computer Science at `The University of Texas at Dallas` where I am advised by Prof.[Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/) at the [CARAML](https://www.caraml-lab.com/) lab. 

Prior to this, I was a `Data and Applied Scientist II` at [Microsoft](https://ads.microsoft.com/?n1pq=caf805e1-b711-4e9d-88e2-c21071f19b24&fdmkt=en-us&fdiso=us&fdtz=-6), BingAds team, where I worked on `Dense Information Retrieval` technique from short phrases (queries). I have also worked as an `Applied Research Scientist` at [Intel](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/homepage.html) India, where I was advised by Dr.[Anbumani Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/anbumani/) to develop perception learning models for autonomous navigation tasks to make self-driving cars safer and more reliable in unconstrained, heterogeneous traffic environments like India (realized through the [India Driving Dataset](https://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/)).

Even Earlier, I worked as an `Undergraduate Researcher` at the Smart Grid Laboratory of [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://chennai.vit.ac.in/) where I was advised by Dr. [Gnana Swathika O.V](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnana-swathika-ov-5923b468?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BjsTx1XUiROmkJpJfQncztw%3D%3D). Here, my research realized a large-scale electrical grid through a `dynamic computation graph` to identify and rectify critical faults without any human intervention.
