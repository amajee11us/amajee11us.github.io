Microgrids are a collections of loads, small sources and storage systems which are present as single, flexible and independently controllable entities [1]. 
The inclusion of Distributed Generation (DGs) systems into a microgrid makes the current flow in a microgid bidirectional. 
The detection of faults and the connection and disconnection of the DGs to and from the microgrid is carried out by the Central Protection Centre (CPC). 
In this paper we aim to develop an automated CPC based on the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) which would 
constantly monitor the grid for the detection of faults and rectify them. The rectification of fault is either done by isolating the faulted bus or 
finding the shortest path from the faulted bus to the main grid.
